DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
- thesis.pdf ---> just the paper, including theoretical results and results of numerical simulations

In the subfolder "codes":
- chi.m  ---> Matlab script for the characteristic function of an interval
- verifica_ipotesi.m ---> Matlab script to empirically check for the validity of the hypotesis required for convergence in the test case
- evoluzione.m ---> Matlab script for the simulation of evolution dynamic described in the paper
- crea_mondo.m ---> Matlab script to launch the actual simulation
